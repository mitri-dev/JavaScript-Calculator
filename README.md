## JavaScript Calculator  
This is my third Utility based Web App, a **Calculator** that runs on your browser! Took the design from the MI calculator from my phone, and made all of the **basic** functionality with a little help (Read JS file for more info).  
### Features  
  - Basic arithmetic operations:  
    - Adition.  
    - Subtraction.  
    - Multiplication.  
    - Division.  
  - Supports **Chain** operations.   
  - Clear button.  
   
This was made with only pure **vanilla JavaScript**.
